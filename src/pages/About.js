            <SectionSubtitle>Hi there! I'm Justin, currently studying towards a Bachelors 
                degree in Computer Science at University College London. At the moment, 
                I'm focused on discovering the depths of machine learning (and learning 
                to trade on the side for a few quick bucks ðŸ˜Ž). I hope to someday be able 
                to develop a sit-back-and-relax trading bot that can perform well even when 
                the market takes a dive!
            </SectionSubtitle><br></br>
            <SectionSubtitle>During lockdowns and the pandemic, I made use of the extra free 
                time I had and enrolled in courses related to machine learning, finance and 
                web development (and design), while occasionally building webapps and 
                automated projects.
